[![Github Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-hmohammadi-grey?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white&link=https://github.com/hmohammadi/)](https://www.github.com/hmohammadi/) <p align='left'>As an expert PHP developer with about 7+ years of experience in WordPress, and an Avid free software lover and contributor, I'm always looking forward to learning more and improving my knowledge and skills. I was lucky enough to be a part of various projects, both on-site and remote. I like to challenge my knowledge by creating new software or inventing new and innovative solutions that people can incorporate into their work and remember me as the one who made their job easier.</p>
